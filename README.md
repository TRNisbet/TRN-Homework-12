## Other Information:
The Github repo this project is: https://github.com/TRNisbet/TRN-Homework-12. The video demonstration is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msABeRY0cxw8BHFeZshlyH5J4ynhczxC/view.  The project as submitted has flaws.  The display of employees is showing the employees multiple times.  Assigning a new department does not ask for a new ID, there is not a way to edit existing information.  Time restraints and early problems building the project caused a lack of time to get the entire project up to standards.
